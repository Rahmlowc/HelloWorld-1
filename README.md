    <h1> Hello World </h1>
    <p> I decided to take this class because I've taken tech classes in the past and have enjoyed them. Technology can sometimes be frustrating to me (especially coding when little mistakes can throw off your whole work) but I enjoy the challenge (especially when it pays off). Most of all, I would like to learn the basics of designing websites to expand my learning and possibly use it in my job someday. </p>
